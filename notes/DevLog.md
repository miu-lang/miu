# Development Log

### Editor support

- Took a stab at setting up an Emacs major mode for use in Spacemacs,
  which does syntax highlighting.
  It was surprisingly simple with the help of the tree-sitter-emacs package,
  and looking at the code for gleam-lang/gleam-mode.
  Using Sourcegraph a bunch also helped
  with searching for code examples
  involving various elisp functions.

### Grammar

- Spent some more time fiddling with the tree-sitter grammar.
  Looks like there are one or more bugs with the scanning part,
  I got a hang on entering a newline after a basic expression
  like `let x = 10`.

### Build system

- Successfully got a minimal example with Bazel working using a Cargo.lock
  file, as well as a `build.rs` file (after a bunch of fiddling).
  It looks like it generates files and declarations on-the-fly,
  which was tripping me up.
- It seems like the "right" way to ensure full reproducibility is to use Nix,
  since Bazel doesn't really have a way of specifying the C++ toolchain that is used.
  For example, this [blog post by Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2018-03-15-bazel-nix/)
  provides a good overview for why they complement each other.
- Since we're shaving yaks anyways and am not in a rush,
  might as well spend some time fiddling with Nix?

### Grammar

- Spent some time fiddling with the grammar and resolving ambiguities.
  On one hand, adding ~all the grammar constructs up front isn't
  necessarily the best course of action, since the immediate next
  thing I'll need to do is filter out unsupported constructs
  until later stages support those.
  However, it was fun as a distraction. The other aspect is that
  writing down the grammar makes it clearer what syntax might work
  and what syntax might not.

### Architecture

- I was re-reading matklad's blog post on
  [Three Architectures for a Responsive IDE](./Bibliography.md#three-architectures-for-a-responsive-ide),
  and thinking about the architecture we want.
  Ideally, we'd have a simpler architecture than a full
  blown "query-based" compiler, because it seems harder to reach
  the level of performance I want with such an architecture,
  as evidenced by the performance of Rust and Swiftc.
  None of Hack, Skip, Sorbet or Kentucky Mule follow this architecture.
- It's not super clear to me why the map-reduce style architecture
  can't work for something like Rust, with some added indexes.
  See the notes in the link above.

### Build system

- Spent a bunch of time mucking around with Bazel and `rules_rust`
  to figure out how to build `tree-sitter` from source.
  Initially, I thought it would be quick (hah!), and nicer
  because it'd work for all the right platforms (hah! there's
  a C++ toolchain involved).
  Couldn't quite get it to work (it'd probably be better
  to work with smaller examples first).
  So I scribbled with using `http_file` to download a prebuilt
  binary. That was still not fully working, but it's probably
  simpler.
- While Bazel does seem complicated (adding to the complexity,
  they're introducing a new packaging system that is experimental
  in Bazel 5.0.0), it seems like having a good story for incremental
  building and testing is going to be necessary.
  Otherwise, what is likely to happen is that we have some
  homegrown build system which:
  - Needs to be updated to handle different edge cases,
    which are already handled by Bazel.
  - Doesn't handle build caching as well as Bazel
  - Does not support distributed builds
  Another "benefit" of using Bazel is just gaining experience with Bazel,
  which will be helpful for work, and figuring out how a build system
  for Miu could integrate with Bazel.

### Direction

- It seems like one of the key blockers to progress
  is understanding the overall architecture
  that will be needed for Rust interop,
  and what tradeoffs it will have.
  (Bunch of these are unknowns, since I'm not very familiar
  with the architecture of rust-analyzer or rustc.)
  There are multiple options,
  as noted in the [Rust interop](./RustInterop.md) doc,
  but it's not clear which one is the "right" one.

  Perhaps it would be useful to first write down
  some fake code examples of Rust interop,
  what the use case for the code example would be,
  and what the compiler's behavior should be like.

  It would also be useful to spend a few days understanding
  the overall pipeline in both rustc and rust-analyzer,
  and making notes for each.

### Rust interop

- Wrote some notes about having a link-dependency on Rustc
  vs having a pure data dependency
  by serializing all necessary information "ahead-of-time".

### Rustc exploration

- Spent some time reading code in the `rustc_interface` crate.
  One of the odd things I noticed is that there is a separate
  `parallel_compiler` configuration option; without it,
  the configuration skips using `Send`/`Sync` types
  (like `Rc` instead of `Arc`).
  I wonder when that configuration is used,
  maybe it's for distributed builds?

### Rustc internals

- It seems like Rustc has some internal APIs that can be used.
  They "try not to break things unnecessarily" according to the
  docs on [rustc_driver](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/rustc-driver.html).
  I suspect it's probably best to use Rustc instead of rust-analyzer
  for the batch compiler,
  because we need access to backend information anyways.
  For the IDE compiler, it would make sense to use rust-analyzer. 
  However, the first thing I'd like to do
  is test if this concept can even work or not.
  So it makes sense to try out Rustc first.

### Rust interop

- Added some initial notes on [Rust interop](./RustInterop.md),
  and a [bibliography](./Bibliography.md).

### Parser

- Started migrating tree-sitter grammar from an older prototype.
  Right now, it has a LOT of constructs; I'm wondering if it
  makes sense to start from scratch.
  The grammar isn't really the "hard" part,
  there are many bigger problems to tackle
  (e.g. easy Rust interop, scoping out type-checking work etc.)

### Editor integration

- Thorsten had pointed out on Twitter how easy it was to use
  nvim-treesitter to get syntax highlighting in Neovim.
  I explored this and it "works",
  except that I couldn't get the filetype detection working
  for some reason. üòê
- Sublime's APIs around `Phantom`s haven't changed much
  from the last time I checked, which do not allow selecting text.
- I was looking at VS Code's APIs for extensions. In particular,
  the ["View Zones" and "Overlays"](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/83#issuecomment-272396825)
  functionality seems promising
  for showing multiline information alongside the code.
  ([API signatures](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/7c78640d86e5de1ca0270912584d9d38beafeec1/src/vs/editor/browser/editorBrowser.ts#L29))

### Build system

- Initial investigative work into using Bazel for building things.
  It feels like a high complexity solution,
  but I think it's probably the "right" thing in the long run
  to ensure incrementality and reproducibility.
  This is especially problematic
  because of the number of languages involved:
  - (likely) Rust for the core compiler and runtime.
  - JavaScript/TypeScript for a VS Code extension.
  - A C/C++ toolchain for compiling the tree-sitter grammar.
    Ideally, tree-sitter would generate Rust code,
    but that seems like a big undertaking,
    given that the tree-sitter runtime
    has a bunch of C code (10k~15k lines).
  - Maybe Racket/Scribble for docs?
